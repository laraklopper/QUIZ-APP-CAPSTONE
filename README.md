## PSEUDO CODE
### PART-ONE
#### ***Create and submit:***
##### (1) **A README.md document that contains the software requirements documentation:**

**1. System Architecture:**
- Describing the intended architecture for developing the application: provide motivation for the choice of architecture.
- What tools will be used to style the application: provide motivation for the choice?

**2. System requirements specification:**

- Explain how the application will work, who will use the application and how they will benefit from using it.
- Explain what other software there is that does something similar, and the software will be different.
- list all the functional and non-functional requirements. 

##### (2)	Create wireframes how the front-end (user-interface) will look and work.
***When creating/designing the wireframes/user-interface keep the following guidelines in mind:***
- Keep the UI (user interface) simple.
- Create consistency and use the common UI elements.
- Be purposeful in page layout.
- Strategically use colour and texture.
- Use typography to create hierarchy and clarity.
- Make sure that the system communicates what’s happening.

### PART-TWO

#### PROJECT REQUIREMENTS:

***Design any web application, as long as it meets the following requirements:***

-	It is built using Express.js, React.js, and MongoDB (the MERN stack),
-	It creates, reads, updates, and deletes (CRUD) information from MongoDB.
-	It has a custom server built using Express.
-	It authenticates users using JWT.
-	The front-end is built using React. Use a React framework (e.g. Create React App or Next.js) of your choice.	
-	The application should allow for normal end-user access and admin access. (An administrator should be able to monitor and make changes to users’ behaviour.)

**Submission Criteria**

**Code, test and debug the application designed in part 1.**

***SUBMIT***
1.	The source code for the project. Delete/don’t submit the node_modules directories and submit all the compressed project folders for the front-end and back-end. Ensure that the code meets the following criteria:
- The UI  (user interface) should be attractive, easy to use and intuitive. Incorporate any suggestions received from the reviewer for part one regarding UI design.
-	Ensure that the application has appropriately been tested include at least one snapshot test and the appropriate unit tests for both the front-end and back-end for the application.
- A reviewer should be able to launch the application by typing ‘npm start’ from the command line interface.
-	Create a well organised and easy to understand and to use file structure of the project.
-	The code should be well documented with appropriate comments.
-	Write the code in a manner that is easy to read, adhering to Google’s style guide about indentation, meaningful variable names, and component names, etc.
-	The code should be modular to make testing, debugging, code reuse and maintenance of the application easier.

2.	An extended version of the README.md file in part 1 of the task. The README.md file must include:
-	An clear explanation of how to use the application.
-	Clear instructions that the end-user should be able to follow to install, test and run the application on their local machine – which includes:
-	Instructions for modifying any MongoDB URI’s or API keys; 
3.	A clear description of: 
-	the measures taken to ensure the security of the application including a description of how API keys have been dealt with; any third-party API’s used in the code; 
-	how the application has been deployed,  how it was been deployed (Back-end or front-end together or separately and why? ); and 
-	link or links to the deployed application.
